                        <p>Private Limited Company, the most popular legal structure for businesses, should be chosen by anyone looking to build a scalable business. It is one of the most popular legal structure option for businesses in India. A Private limited company has a minimum of two members and a maximum of fifty members. A director of a private limited company has limited liability to creditors. In case of a default, banks / creditors can sell only company’s assets but not the personal assets of a directors. A Private limited company is considered one of the most popular corporate entity amongst the small, medium and the large businesses in India due to its various advantages.</p>
                        <p>Start-ups and growing businesses choose to register a company in India because it allows outside funding to be raised easily, limits the liabilities of its shareholders and enables them to offer employee stock options to attract top talent. As these entities must hold board meetings and file annual returns with the <a href="http://mca.gov.in/" target="_blank">Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA),</a> they tend also to be viewed with more credibility than a <a href="/llp-registration" target="_blank">Limited Liability Partnership (LLP),</a> <a href="/one-person-company-opc-in-india" target="_blank">One Person Company (OPC),</a> or <a href="/partnership-firm" target="_blank">General Partnership.</a> At VakilSearch, we are continuously available to help you understand how to register a private limited company. Company Registration in India can be done through VakilSearch in all major cities including&nbsp;Hyderabad, Mumbai, and New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata &amp; all other Indian cities.</p>

                        <p>The process for registration of a company is governed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs,&nbsp;Companies Act, 2013&nbsp;and the Companies Incorporation Rules, 2014. A natural person can be a director and as well as shareholder, where a corporate legal entity can only be a shareholder. In addition to that, foreign nationals, foreign corporate entities or NRIs are also allowed to be the Directors and/or Shareholders of a Company with Foreign Direct Investment, making it the preferred choice of entity for foreign promoters.</p>
                        <p>Some of the unique features of a private limited company like the limited liability protection to shareholders, the ability to raise the equity funds, separate legal entity status and the perpetual existence make it one of the most recommended type of business entity for the millions of small and medium sized businesses that are owned by families or professionally managed.</p>
                        <p>It takes 10-15 working days on an average to complete online company registration, subject to the government processing time and the client document submission.</p>

                                <h4>What if I am a single founder?</h4>
                                <p>A private limited company is an entity with two directors and two shareholders at the minimum. If you are a single shareholder, you can also bring in your mother, father or any other relative to be part of the limited company with just one single share.</p>

                                <h4>Why do start-ups prefer private limited companies?</h4>
                                <p>Simple. Start-ups set-up private limited companies so that they can raise venture capital funding and offer their best employees stock options. Without funding and stock options, it's almost impossible to build and scale a large business. Banks and other lenders would also much rather lend to private limited companies, as compared to sole proprietors.</p>

                                <h4>What is the procedure to register one?</h4>
                                <p>Initially, we help you get a digital signature certificate (also known as DSC), which is nothing but an e-signature to help you complete the new company registration online. It usually takes two days to get the DSC from the time you submit the documents. Next, we apply for the Director Identification Number (also called a DIN). This typically takes one day. The third phase involves selection of a name for your company. Now, do remember that your company name need not be your brand name. For example, <a href="http://naukri.com" target="_blank">Naukri.com</a> has been incorporated as InfoEdge Technologies. Once done, we will prepare the Memorandum and Articles of Association and apply for the Certificate of Incorporation.<br></p>

                                <h4>How many shareholders can there be in a private limited company?</h4>
                                <p>A private limited company must have at least two directors and shareholders, and can have a maximum of 15 directors and 50 shareholders.</p>

                                <p>Good news. You don't need to invest any money upfront. Most entrepreneurs do bring computers and other necessities at the very beginning. These can be the assets of the company. Private limited companies in India do not need to have any paid-up capital (that is, they do not need to introduce any money into the company).</p>

                                <h4>What regulatory requirements are placed on private limited company?</h4>
                                <p>As private limited companies are not traded publicly, regulatory requirements placed on them are fewer than on public companies. For example, they need not disclose their books of accounts. Because of this advantage, they need only worry about the long term rather than face the music from their shareholders in case their results in a particular quarter are poor.</p>

                                <h4>Limited Liability</h4>
                                <p>Businesses often need to borrow money. In structures such as General Partnership, partners are personally liable for all the debt raised. So if it cannot be repaid by the business, the partners would have to sell their personal possessions to do so. In a private limited company, only the amount invested in starting the business would be lost; the directors' personal property would be safe.</p>

                                <h4>Separate Legal Entity</h4>
                                <p>A Private Limited Company is legal entity and juristic person established under the Companies Act. Therefore, a company has a large range of legal capacities including that of opening of a bank account, hiring employees, taking on the equity or obtaining the licenses and more as an independent corporate entity. A member (Shareholders/Directors) of a company has no personal liability to the creditors of a company for company's debts.</p>

                                <h4>Investment-ready</h4>
                                <p>Private limited companies easily accommodate equity funding as there is a clear distinction between shareholders and directors as well as limited liability. In fact, venture capitalists and private equity funds are unlikely to invest in any other structure. This is because LLPs would require them to become partners in the business, while an OPC can have only one shareholder. This feature also gives you the ability to hire top talent you may not be able to afford by merely paying a salary.</p>

                                <p>A private limited company has more options for taking on debt than LLPs. Not only are bank loans easy to obtain (relative to OPCs and LLPs), the option of issuing debentures and convertible debentures are always available to it.</p>

                                <p>A Private Limited Company can raise the equity funds in India. The Companies can also issue equity shares, preference shares, debentures and accept the deposits with RBI permission. The Banks and Financial Institutions prefer to provide the funding to a company rather than the partnership firms or proprietary concerns.</p>

                                <p>A Private Limited Company has 'perpetual succession', that means, it has an uninterrupted existence until it is legally dissolved. As a company is a separate legal person, it is unaffected by death or other the departure of any member and it continues to be in existence irrespective of the changes in ownership.</p>

                                <p>The ownership of a business can be very easily transferred in a company by transferring the shares. The signing, transfer and filing of share transfer form and the share certificates is adequate to transfer the ownership of a company. In a private limited company, the consent of other shareholders may be required to effect share transfers.</p>

What are the rules for picking a name for a private limited company? </a> </h4> </div> <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingOne" aria-expanded="false"> <div class="panel-body"> The Registrar of Companies (RoC) across India expect applicant to follow a few naming guidelines. Some of them are subjective, which means that approval can depend on the opinion of the officer handling your application. However, the more closely you follow the rules listed below, the better your chances of approval. First, however, do ensure that your <a href="https://vakilsearch.com/company-name-search" target="_blank">name is available</a>.<br> <strong>Unique Component:</strong> In Flipkart Internet Private Limited, Flipkart is the unique component. Now, once taken, the name Flipkart will not be given to any other business within the suffix Internet or even related categories (E-commerce and Online Solutions, for example). But there is some subjectivity, too. Some RoCs may not even approve the name Flipkart Chemicals Private Limited, reasoning that the e-commerce brand Flipkart is too well-known. Similar sounding names would also be rejected (so no Flipkart).<br> <strong>Blacklist:</strong> Abbreviations, adjectives and generic words are rejected. So BBC or XYZ would be rejected, as would Good Quality Biscuits. The words bank, exchange and stock exchange, unless approved by RBI or SEBI, would also be rejected.<br> <strong>No Common Trademark:</strong> There should not be a registered trademark by the same name on the IP India website. If there is one, the name can only be approved if you are able to get a No-Objection Certificate from its owner authorising you to use it.<br> <strong>Descriptive Component:</strong> In Biocon Research Private Limited, the word 'Research' describes the business the company is into. You cannot have 'Research' in your name if you're, say, in the logistics or restaurant business. </div> </div> </div> <div class="panel panel-default"> <div class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="headingOne"> <h4 class="panel-title"> <a role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseFour" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseOne" class="collapsed"> <i class="more-less glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></i> 4.
